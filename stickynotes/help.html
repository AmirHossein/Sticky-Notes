				<b>I lost my note and can't find it after editing!</b><br />
				There is a structure to sort notes:
				<ul>
					<li>Deleting notes always sends them to Trash!</li>
					<li>Archived notes moves to Archived UNLESS they're deleted.</li>
					<li>Finished notes moves to Finished UNLESS they're deleted or archived.</li>
					<li>Assigning notes to other users sends notes to ToDo panel UNLESS they're deleted or archived.</li>
					<li>Other notes stay on left side panel.</li>
				</ul>
				If you still have problem, use search box at the bottom of page. You could search by 'Title' and 'Comment'.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>I've deleted a note and its placed in Trash. How can i restore it?</b><br />
				Try to Edit deleted note. You can see a new checkbox "<b>Restore</b>" in the form. Check it and Save.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Some sections refreshes automatically on startup. What about others?</b><br />
				When you click on a section title e.g. "ToDo list" or "Finished Tasks" and etc, the section collapses and a Cookie is created.
				The collapsed sections will NOT refresh in next start automatically. So you can prevent refreshing sections you like by collapssing them.
			</li>
